# 👚 Clothing Recommendation App

## 📌 Overview

Hello everyone!  
This is my Capstone project, and the topic I chose is **Clothing Recommendation**.

I was inspired to build this app because of my mother, who owns a small clothing business called **Comfy Pajama Shop**. When too many customers visit her shop at the same time, it becomes difficult for her to assist everyone and answer their questions.

To help with this challenge, I created a **Streamlit web app** that allows customers to get clothing recommendations and shop information more efficiently by scanning a QR code on their phones.

### 🛍️ Tab 2: Similar Product Recommendations
The app recommends **3 visually and contextually similar products** based on the uploaded image.
