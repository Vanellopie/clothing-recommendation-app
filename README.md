üëö Clothing Recommendation App
Hello everyone!
This project is my Capstone work, and the topic I chose is Clothing Recommendation.

I was inspired to work on this idea because of my mother, who owns a small business called Comfy Pajama Shop. Sometimes, when many customers enter her store at the same time, she becomes overwhelmed and doesn‚Äôt have enough time to answer everyone's questions.

To help with this issue, I developed a solution using a Streamlit web app. When multiple customers arrive, they can simply scan a QR code with their phones to access the recommendation app. Here's how the app works:

üßµ Tab 1: Product Information
Customers can upload photos of the clothing item they are interested in, such as sleepwear or other apparel. The app will automatically provide key details about the product, including:

‚Ä¢ Category
‚Ä¢ Size
‚Ä¢ Color
‚Ä¢ Material
‚Ä¢ Price

üõçÔ∏è Tab 2: Similar Product Recommendations
Based on the uploaded image, the app will display three visually and contextually similar products, offering helpful alternatives and suggestions.

üí¨ Tab 3: Comfy Pajama Shop Chatbot
This tab includes a chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions and provide useful information related to the Comfy Pajama Shop, making it easier for customers to get the assistance they need.
