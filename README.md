# 👚 Clothing Recommendation App

## 📌 Overview

Hello everyone!  
This is my Capstone project, and the topic I chose is **Clothing Recommendation**.

I was inspired to work on this idea because of my mother, who owns a small business called Comfy Pajama Shop. Sometimes, when many customers enter her store at the same time, she becomes overwhelmed and doesn’t have enough time to answer everyone's questions.

To help with this challenge, I created a **Streamlit web app** that allows customers to get clothing recommendations and shop information more efficiently by scanning a QR code on their phones.

## 🌟 Features

### 🧵 Tab 1: Product Information
Customers can upload an image of the clothing item they’re interested in. The app will identify and display:
- **Category**
- **Size**
- **Color**
- **Material**
- **Price**

### 🛍️ Tab 2: Similar Product Recommendations
The app recommends **3 visually and contextually similar products** based on the uploaded image.

### 💬 Tab 3: Comfy Pajama Shop Chatbot
This tab includes a chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions and provide useful information related to the Comfy Pajama Shop, making it easier for customers to get the assistance they need, like the shop schedule, location, etc.

• I haven't finished training my model yet, so it's not yet possible to directly upload an image from Google or the store, so please download any image from the "data" section and upload it. Thank you.
